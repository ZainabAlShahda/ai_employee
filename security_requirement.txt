Platinum Tier: Always-On Cloud + Local Executive (Production-ish AI 
Employee) 
Estimated time: 60+ hours 
All Gold requirements plus: 
1. Run the AI Employee on Cloud 24/7 (always-on watchers + orchestrator + health 
monitoring). You can deploy a Cloud VM (Oracle/AWS/etc.) - Oracle Cloud Free VMs 
can be used for this (subject to limits/availability). 
2. Work-Zone Specialization (domain ownership): 
a. Cloud owns: Email triage + draft replies + social post drafts/scheduling 
(draft-only; requires Local approval before send/post) 
b. Local owns: approvals, WhatsApp session, payments/banking, and final 
“send/post” actions 
3. Delegation via Synced Vault (Phase 1) 
a. Agents communicate by writing files into: 
i. 
/Needs_Action/<domain>/, /Plans/<domain>/, 
/Pending_Approval/<domain>/ 
b. Prevent double-work using: 
i. 
/In_Progress/<agent>/ claim-by-move rule 
ii. 
iii. 
single-writer rule for Dashboard.md (Local) 
Cloud writes updates to /Updates/ (or /Signals/), and Local merges them 
into Dashboard.md. 
c. For Vault sync (Phase 1) use Git (recommended) or Syncthing. 
d. Claim-by-move rule: first agent to move an item from /Needs_Action to 
/In_Progress/<agent>/ owns it; other agents must ignore it. 
4. Security rule: Vault sync includes only markdown/state. Secrets never sync (.env, 
tokens, WhatsApp sessions, banking creds). So Cloud never stores or uses WhatsApp 
sessions, banking credentials, or payment tokens. 
5. Deploy Odoo Community on a Cloud VM (24/7) with HTTPS, backups, and health 
monitoring; integrate Cloud Agent with Odoo via MCP for draft-only accounting actions 
and Local approval for posting invoices/payments. 
6. Optional A2A Upgrade (Phase 2): Replace some file handoffs with direct A2A messages 
later, while keeping the vault as the audit record 
7. Platinum demo (minimum passing gate): Email arrives while Local is offline → Cloud 
drafts reply + writes approval file → when Local returns, user approves → Local 
executes send via MCP → logs → moves task to /Done.
